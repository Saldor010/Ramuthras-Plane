So, you ran into a bug, hm? Well, you've come to the right place!

** Bug report **

If you want to get help quickly, here's what I need to know from you:

1. What ComputerCraft version are you running and are you using an emulator?
2. What version of Ramuthra's Plane are you running?
3. What level were you on (if applicable)?
4. What steps do you remember taking that caused the bug?
5. Do you have any screenshots or videos that you can share that showcases the bug (it's okay if you don't)?

If the answer to question 2 is anything other than the most recent version, download the latest version of Ramuthra's Plane and see if the bug persists before submitting a report.
